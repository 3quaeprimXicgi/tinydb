However, some Huawei devices are locked by the network operators or the manufacturers, which prevents users from using other SIM cards or custom ROMs. To unlock these devices, users need to flash a different firmware file that bypasses the lock. This is where Huawei HiSilicon Firmware Writer comes in handy.
 
Huawei HiSilicon Firmware Writer can detect the device model, chipset, IMEI, and firmware version automatically. It can also backup the original firmware file before writing a new one. Users can choose from a list of supported firmware files or browse for a custom one. The software can also repair damaged or corrupted firmware files.
 
However, Huawei HiSilicon Firmware Writer is not a free software. Users need to purchase a license to use it. The latest version of the software is v24, which costs $98. But some users have managed to crack the software and make it available for free download. This is illegal and may violate the terms and conditions of Huawei and HiSilicon.
 
Users who download and use the cracked version of Huawei HiSilicon Firmware Writer may face some risks and disadvantages. For example, the cracked software may contain malware or viruses that can harm the user's computer or device. The cracked software may also not work properly or cause errors or damage to the device. Moreover, the user may lose the warranty or support from Huawei or HiSilicon if they use the cracked software.
 
Therefore, users who want to unlock their Huawei devices using Huawei HiSilicon Firmware Writer should purchase the original software from the official website[^1^] or authorized resellers. This way, they can ensure the safety and quality of the software and avoid any legal issues.

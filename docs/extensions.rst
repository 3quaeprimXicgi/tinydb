| **Status:**      *experimental*
| **Description:** Tinyrecord is a library which implements experimental atomic
                   transaction support for the TinyDB NoSQL database. It uses a
                   record-first then execute architecture which allows us to
                   minimize the time that we are within a thread lock.
